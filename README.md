## Project Overview

This project develops **responsible AI approaches** for mental health screening and analysis. We prioritize ethical considerations, privacy protection, and clinical validation while leveraging machine learning to support healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention.

### Key Features
- **Privacy-Preserving Methods** - Differential privacy and secure computation
- **Clinical Validation** - Evidence-based feature selection and validation
- **Bias Mitigation** - Fair representation across demographics
- **Interpretable Models** - Explainable AI for clinical decision support
- **Ethical Framework** - Responsible AI guidelines throughout

## Ethical Framework & Approach

### **Privacy & Consent**
- Differential privacy implementation for data protection
- Anonymization techniques for sensitive health data
- GDPR and HIPAA compliance considerations
- Clear consent frameworks for data usage

### **Clinical Responsibility**
- Designed to **support**, not replace, clinical judgment
- Validated against established screening instruments
- Integration with existing healthcare workflows
- Clear limitations and uncertainty quantification

### **Bias & Fairness**
- Demographic fairness across age, gender, ethnicity
- Culturally sensitive feature engineering
- Robust evaluation across diverse populations
- Continuous monitoring for algorithmic bias

## Technical Implementation

### **Data Science Pipeline**
```python
# Privacy-preserving data processing
# Clinical feature extraction
# Bias-aware model development
# Interpretability framework
# Validation against clinical standards
```

### **Cloud Architecture**
