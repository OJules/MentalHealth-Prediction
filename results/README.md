## 🎯 How to Generate Results

Run the analysis to populate this directory:
```bash
python mental_health_prediction.py
```

The clinical validation workflow:
1. **Privacy Protection** - Differential privacy and anonymization
2. **Model Development** - Bias-aware and interpretable ML
3. **Clinical Validation** - Performance against established instruments
4. **Healthcare Integration** - Workflow and usability assessment

## 📈 Key Clinical Indicators

Expected validation metrics:
- **Sensitivity:** Early detection capability (target: >0.85)
- **Specificity:** Avoiding false alarms (target: >0.80)
- **PPV/NPV:** Predictive value in clinical context
- **Fairness Metrics:** Equal performance across demographics
